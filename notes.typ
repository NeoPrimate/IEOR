= Lead Time

Why $sqrt(L)$?

Setup

Daily demand has mean $mu$ and standard deviation $sigma$

Say:
- $mu=100$
- $sigma=20$

One day:
- Mean is $mu = 100$
- Spread is $sigma = 20$

Two days:
- Demand: $D_1 + D_2$ (each day is independent)

Mean add:

$
  EE[D_1 + D_2] = mu_1 + mu_2 = 2mu = 200
$

But standard deviations do *NOT* add, Variances add:

$
  "Var"(D_1 + D_2) = "Var"(D_1) + "Var"(D_2) = sigma_1^2 + sigma_2^2 = 2 sigma^2
$

So:

$
  "Std"(D_1 + D_2) = sqrt(2 sigma^2) = sigma sqrt(2)
$

Generalize to $L$ days:

$
  "Var"(sum_(t=1)^L D_t) = L dot sigma^2
$

$
  "Std"(sum_(t=1)^L D_t) = sigma sqrt(L)
$

- Mean scales with $L$
- Std scales with $sqrt(L)$

= Multi-Echelon Inventory

Setup:

Consider a serial system with $N$ stages, where stage $N$ faces stochastic customer demand and each replenished from stage $j + 1$ with deterministic lead time $L_j$:

$
  "Stage" N arrow "Stage" (N - 1) arrow dots arrow "Stage" 1 arrow "External Supplier"
$

Echelon inventory position at stage $j$:

f



// #line(width: 100%)

Demand
- $mu$: 100 units
- $sigma$: 20 units
Lead time:
- $L_(f, w)$: 4 days
- $L_(f)$: 5 days

The question: *where do we keep safety stock?*





Safety stock formula:

$
  "SS" = k dot sigma dot sqrt(L)
$

With $k = 2$ ($approx 9%$ service level), $sigma = 20$, $L = 4$ days:

$
  "SS"_w = 2 dot 20 dot sqrt(4) = 80 "units"
$
