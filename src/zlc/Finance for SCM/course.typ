= Finance of Supply Chain Management



Everything is *stocks* and *flows*

== Accounting Rules

+ Financial (transactions -> accounts)
  - Provides information primarily to people *outside* the company
    - Equity & Debt
    - Credit from suppliers
    - Customers
    - Employees
+ Managerial 
  - Provides information primarily to people *inside* the company
    - internal investment decisions
    - performance monitoring & evaluation

== Concepts of Financial Accounting

- Conservatism: 
- Materiality: 
- Consistency: 
- Economic Entity: 
- Going Concern: 
- Accounting Period: 
- Cost Concept: 

== Principles of Accrual Accounting

Attempt to measure firm performance *regarless of when cash is exchanged*
- Revenue Recognition
  - Earnings process complete
  - Cash collection assured
- Mathcing Principles
  - Match effort to the benefits generted
  - Capitalize expenditure that will benefit future periods, expense as benefit are realized 
  - Recognize liability when efforts benefiting the period require cash payment in the future

== Financial Statements

// + BS: Balance Sheet
  
//   Inventory -> Account Receivables -> Cash

//   - Current assets: Cash, Account Receivables, Inventory
//   - Current liabilities: Account payables, debt

//   Equity (residual sharholders) calculated from Assets - Liabilities

//   Equity last to be payed (first banks, then Account payables, then employees)

//   Non-current assets:
//   - Investments
//   - Goodwill
//   - Fixed assets
//     - Useful service life
//     - Salvage value
//     - Depreciation method (production (use) method, straight line, accelerated)

//   OWC = Min Cash + Account Receivable + Inventory - Account Payable

// + Income Statement (P&L: Profit & Loss)
//   Revenue (-) Expenses = Net Income

//   Sales - COGS = GP - SGA = EBITDA - D&A = EBIT - Interest = EBT - Tax = NP

//   Inventory is not included so CF is used to reconsile BS and P&L

// + CF: Cash Flow
//   Operating, Investing & Financial Activities

- *Cash*: Money immediately available to spend. 
  
  \$50,000 sitting in the company's checking account.

- *Accounts Receivable*: Money owed by customers for sales already made on credit. 
  
  You deliver \$10,000 of consulting work in March, invoice the client with 30-day terms — that \$10,000 is receivable until they pay.

- *Inventory*: Goods held for sale but not yet sold. 

  A shoe retailer has \$200,000 of unsold shoes sitting in its warehouse.

- *PP&E*: Long-lived physical assets used to run the business. 

  A factory building and its production machinery, carried at \$2M after depreciation.

- *Accounts Payable*: Money owed to suppliers for goods/services already received but not yet paid for. 

  You receive \$5,000 of raw materials from a supplier on 60-day payment terms — that \$5,000 is payable until you pay it.

- *Debt*: Borrowed money owed to lenders, usually with interest. 

  A \$1M bank loan taken out to fund expansion.

- *Equity*: Owners' residual stake — assets minus liabilities. 

  Founders put in \$100,000 and the company has since kept \$400,000 of profit rather than paying it out — equity is \$500,000.

- *Sales*: Revenue — total money brought in from selling goods or services, before any costs are subtracted. Also called "revenue" or the "top line."
- *GP* (Gross Profit): Sales − COGS. What's left after covering the direct cost of producing or delivering what was sold.
- *EBITDA* (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization): GP − SGA in this chain. A rough proxy for core operating profitability, stripped of financing costs, taxes, and non-cash charges — often used to compare operating performance across companies with different debt loads or asset ages.
- *EBIT* (Earnings Before Interest & Taxes): EBITDA − D&A. Also called "Operating Income" — profit from core operations after accounting for the wear-down of assets, but still before financing costs and taxes.
- *EBT* (Earnings Before Tax): EBIT − Interest. Pre-tax profit, after the cost of servicing debt.
- *NP* (Net Profit / Net Income): EBT − Tax. The bottom line — what's actually left over for shareholders or retained earnings.
- *COGS* (Cost of Goods Sold): The direct costs of producing or acquiring what was sold — materials, direct labor, manufacturing costs. Excludes overhead, marketing, and admin.
- *SGA* (Selling, General & Administrative): Indirect operating costs to run the business that aren't tied directly to production — sales and marketing, administrative salaries, rent, overhead.
- *D&A* (Depreciation & Amortization): A non-cash expense that spreads the cost of long-lived assets over their useful life — depreciation for tangible assets like PP&E, amortization for intangibles like patents or acquired goodwill.
- *Interest*: Interest expense — the cost of servicing debt, i.e. interest paid on loans and bonds.
- *Tax*: Income tax expense — taxes owed on EBT.

#example([Ethan's New Firm])[
  On January 1, 2023, Ethan Buell and his friend Ryan started a business to import product X from Germany and sell it in the United States. Product X had been launched successfully in Germany the previous year, and Ethan and Ryan believed it offered a sound business opportunity.
  
  Facts from January 1 to June 30, 2023
  1. On January 1, Ethan and Ryan each deposited \$10,000 in a bank account to start the business.
  2. Also on January 1, the firm borrowed \$20,000 from a local bank at 10% interest per year. The loan is expected to be repaid in installments: 50% on June 30 and 50% at the end of the year.
  3. On the same day, they rented a store for the six-month accounting period and paid the full rent of \$12,000 in advance.
  4. The firm bought equipment needed to operate the store for \$9,000 cash. Ethan and Ryan estimate that the equipment will last three years and will have no residual value.
  5. The first batch of product X cost \$36,000. The firm paid \$15,000 cash and agreed to pay the remainder to the supplier later.
  6. Some defective units from the first batch, costing \$6,000, were returned to the supplier, who agreed to take them back.
  7. On January 1, the firm hired a store assistant. Her salary is \$1,800 per month.
  8. The store opened on January 3.
  9. On April 15, a second batch of product X was purchased for \$48,000 on account.
  10. Sales during the six-month period totaled \$80,000. Customers paid 70% in cash. The cost of the units sold was \$36,000.
  11. The firm paid \$18,000 to the supplier, reducing the balance owed for the first batch.
  12. The firm collected \$8,000 from customers who had initially bought on credit. The remaining customer balance is expected to be collected after June 30.
  13. Utilities for the six-month period totaled \$2,400 and were paid in cash.
  14. During the six-month period, the store assistant was paid \$9,800 cash. The remaining amount will be paid shortly after June 30.
  15. No interest was paid to the bank during the accounting period.
  16. On June 30, the firm recognized the full six months of rent expense and six months of depreciation on the equipment.
  17. On June 30, the firm repaid half of the bank loan principal.
  18. On June 30, Ethan received a call from an important retailer that was interested in buying a large amount of product X regularly.

#example([Vending Machines])[

  During his stay in Switzerland in 2012, when he was about to finish his MBA, Sanjay Menon had an idea in mind to start a new business back home in India. In several European airports, he had seen some vending machines selling electronics (like iPods) rather than soft drinks or other inexpensive products. He thought that importing and selling those new-generation vending machines in India could be a good idea, especially when some of his relatives were already involved in the industry of vending services. However, Sanjay did not have much money, so he showed his business plan to his rich uncle Anoop Patnaik, so as to get him involved in the new firm as the main shareholder. 
  - Anoop accepted to invest in the business, so they both went ahead and made a bank deposit of \$120,000 (Sanjay invested \$20,000, his uncle \$100,000) as equity for the new firm. 
  - Additionally, at the end of the year, they borrowed some money from a bank (\$40,000, 10% p.a.) to avoid potential cash tensions. 
  - On December 30, they bought a small warehouse to store the machines, whose price was \$100,000 (\$40,000 the land, \$60,000 the building). Sanjay paid \$80,000 cash; the remaining amount was agreed to be paid on Dec 30 the following year. Both shareholders estimated the life of the warehouse to be 20 additional years. 
  - The same day, Anoop bought some necessary furniture to run the business, paying \$4,000 cash. That furniture was supposed to last five years. 
  
  The last day of the year, Sanjay and Anoop met to assess the situation of the firm. No machines had been sold yet. Sanjay had prepared the cash report shown below.

  - Sanjay also mentioned that there were 20 machines in the warehouse, whose total cost had been \$2,000 each. Anoop read the report and told Sanjay that the information was not sufficient. He then asked for the Balance Sheet of the firm (Dec 31, 2012). Sanjay did not know exactly how to prepare it, but did his best.

  During 2013, Sanjay was in charge of the business, taking care of cash flows (i.e., cash inputs and outputs), but not really paying attention to the financial situation of the firm. Time went by quickly. At the beginning of December 2013, Sanjay got an e-mail from his uncle requiring the following information for year 2013:
  - Balance Sheet (Dec 31)
  - Income Statement
  - Statement of Cash Flows

  Sanjay gathered all the information he was able to find regarding operations during 2013 and summarized it as follows:
  1. The firm imported 170 additional machines (on account, i.e., using trade credit), \$2,000 each.
  2. Fifty machines were sold (cash), at \$3,000 each.
  3. One hundred machines were sold (on account), \$3,300 each.
  4. During 2013, \$250,000 were collected from customers who had not paid cash.
  5. Likewise, the firm paid the cost of 140 machines to the supplier.
  6. General and administrative expenses totaled \$20,000 (paid cash).
  7. The remaining money corresponding to the warehouse was paid.
  8. On Dec 31, 2013, half of the bank debt (i.e., \$20,000) was repaid.
  9. Interest of the loan was paid.

Inventory valuation 
1. Product costing

- Direct v. Indicrect Costs
  - Direct: Expenses that directly go into producing goods specific to the operation (direct labor, direct materials, mfg supplies)
  - Indirect: General business expenses for operations shared between operations (indirect labor, rent, utilities)

- Fixed v. Variable Costs
  - Fixed: Does not depend on the volume of activity
  - Variable: Varies in relation to volume

2. Flow assumption




- Absorbtion costing
  - Direct cost 
  - Fixed & variable overhead (indirect costs)
- Direct (variable) costing

== Activity based costing 

(Cost to serve) (activity based costing / pricing)

Depend on complexity of activity, shipments, service

A pricing strategy that sets prices based on the actual overhead and indirect resources a product, service, or customer consumes

Determine how much each customer costs

Normal costing can hide profitable and unprofitable customers

- Amount of money being spent on a customer (focus on large sums)
- Variability of customer behavior (cost to serve variation) (focus on high variability activities). Different use / consumption between customers.

Profit Margin

$
  "Net Margin" = "NP" / "Sales"
$

Gross Margin

$
  "Gross Margin" = "GP" / "Sales"  
$

Net Profit: Alot of random costs go into it (Aquisition, Building burned)

Gross Profit: Focus on this, less random stuff goes into it

$
  "Asset Turnover" = "Sales" / "Totoal Assets"
$

We are operations people: remove cash / and intangibles (fixed assets) to get a clearer picture

Days of Inventory 

$
  "DIO" = ("Inventory" times 365) / "COGS"
$

On average how many days inventory lasts in the firm

Inventory Turns

$
  "IT" = "COGS" / "Inventory"
$

On average how many times per year inventory enters and leaves the firm

Use Average (always, for everything) coming from balance sheet

Gross Margin Return on Inventory

$
  "GMROI" = "Gross Profit" / "Inventory" = "GP" / "Sales" times "Sales" / "Inventory"
$

How much gross profit per dollar of inventory

Days of Sales Outstanding 

$
  "DSO" = ("Account Receivable" times 365) / "Sales"
$

On average what is the credit you offer your customer

Days Payable Outstanding 

$
  "DPO" = ("Account Payable" times 365) / ("Purchases" ("CoGS"))
$

On average how long does it take you to pay suppliers?

No purchases: Use CoGS

Cash-to-Cash Cycle (CCC)

$
  "CCC" = "DIO" + "DSO" - "DPO"
$

Time elapsed, on average, between payement to supplier and collection from customers

Cash flow (Diagram)

Current Ratio

$
  "Current Ratio" = "Current Assets" / "Current Liability"
$

Times Interest Earned

$
  "Times Interest Earned" = "EBIT" / "Interest Expense"
$


Financial Leverage

$
  "Financial Leverage" = "Debt" / "Equity" \
  "Financial Leverage" = "Total Assets" / "Equity"
$

FL = 1 if interest is 0

$
  "Financial Leverage" = (% Delta "EBT") / (% Delta "EBIT")
$

Operational Leverage

OL = 1 if no fixed costs

$
  "Operational Leverage" = (% Delta "EBIT") / (% Delta "Sales")
$

Return on Net Asset (ROIC or RONA)

$
  "ROIC" = "NOPAT" / (D + E) \
  "NOPAT" = "EBIT" times (1 - "tax rate")
$

Net operating profit after tax

ROE v. ROIC -> Strip out the Debt (Interest / Leverage)?

Assets generate value, Liabilities finance assets

Leverage boosts ROE, more attractive but riskier

$
  "ROE" = "RONA" + D / E \["RONA" - underbrace(i(1 - t), "Efftective tax rate")]
$

$
  i(1 - t) = ("interest rate" (1 - "tax rate"))

- Revenue is the one unambiguous term here — it's the top line, the total amount generated from selling goods or services, before a single cost is subtracted.
- Profit is a generic term for "revenue minus some set of costs," and it's only meaningful once you say which stage you mean
  - Gross Profit (Net Sales - COGS)
  - Operating Profit (Gross Profit - OPEX, i.e. EBIT)
  - Net Profit (the very bottom line, after taxes and everything else)
- Income is generic and stage-dependent 
  - Operating Income (EBIT, Pretax Income, Net Income)
- Earning: Net Income



== Balance Sheet (BS)



== Income Statement (P&L)

Net Sales = Net product sales + Net service sales

Net:
- Sales returns (goods customers sent back)
- Sales allowances (price reductions given for damaged or unsatisfactory goods without a full return)
- Sales discounts (early-payment or volume discounts taken by the customer)

OPEX = Marketing + G&A + Tech & Content + Fulfillment

- OPEX (Operating Expenses) — the recurring costs of running the core business
- Marketing — spend to acquire and retain customers
- G&A (General & Administrative) — corporate overhead that isn't tied to any one function
- Tech & Content — the cost of building and running the technology platform and any content offered to customers
- Fulfillment — the cost of getting an order from warehouse to customer

Gross Profit = Net Sales - COGS

- COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) — the direct cost of the products a company actually sold during the period
  - Purchase price paid to suppliers or manufacturers for the goods sold
  - Inbound freight and shipping to get inventory into the warehouse
  - Outbound shipping and delivery costs to get the product to the customer
  - Packaging materials
  - Write-downs for inventory that's obsolete or unsellable

EBIT = Gross Profit - OPEX

Pretax Income = EBIT - Non-Op (Inc) Loss - Abnormal (Gains)

- EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) — operating profit from the core business, before any financing costs or taxes are applied
- Non-Op (Inc) Loss — "Non-Operating (Income) Loss" — the net effect of financial activity outside core operations 
  - Interest expense on debt
  - Interest income earned on cash
  - Foreign-currency gains/losses
  - Earnings from equity stakes in other companies
- Abnormal (Gains) [Losses] — one-time, non-recurring items with nothing to do with ongoing operations
  - Restructuring charges
  - Asset impairments/write-downs
  - Litigation settlements
  - Gain/loss from selling a business unit
- Pretax Income (also called Income Before Taxes, or EBT) — total earnings after both operating results and these non-operating/unusual items are folded in, but before income tax expense is applied

Net Income = Pretax Income - Income Tax Expense
