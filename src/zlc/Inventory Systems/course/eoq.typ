== Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

$
  "EOQ" = sqrt((2 D S) / H)
$

Assumptions:
- Constant, known demand
- Fixed, known lead time
- No quantity discounts
- Instantaneous full-batch delivery
- No stockouts allowed.

=== Total Cost

$
  "TC"(Q) = underbrace((D / Q) S, "annual\nordering\ncost") quad + quad underbrace((Q/2)H, "annual\nholding\ncost")
$

Where:
- $D$: Demand (units / unit time)

- $Q$: Quantity (units)

- $S$: Ordering cost (\$ / order)

- $H$: Holding cost (\$ / unit / unit time)

- $D/Q$: Number of orders (orders / unit time)

- $Q/2$: Average inventory (units)

- $(D/Q) S$: Number of orders $times$ Ordering cost

- $(Q/2) H$: Average inventory $times$ Holding cost

=== Deriving EOQ from TC

$
  (dif "TC") / (dif Q)
    &= (dif) / (dif Q) [ (D/Q) S + (Q/2) H ] \ \
    &= (dif) / (dif Q) (D S Q^(-1)) + (dif) / (dif Q) (H/2 Q) \ \
    &= D S dot (dif) / (dif Q) (Q^(-1)) + H/2 dot (dif) / (dif Q) (Q) \ \
    &= D S dot (-1) Q^(-2) + H/2 dot 1 \ \
    &= -(D S) / Q^2 + H/2
$

Setting the derivative equal to zero to find the critical point:

$
  -(D S) / Q^2 + H/2 &= 0 \ \
  H/2 &= (D S) / Q^2 \ \
  Q^2 &= (2 D S) / H \ \
  Q &= sqrt((2 D S) / H)
$

To confirm this critical point is a minimum rather than a maximum, check the second derivative:

$
  (dif^2 "TC") / (dif Q^2)
    &= (dif) / (dif Q) (-(D S) / Q^2 + H/2) \ \
    &= (dif) / (dif Q) (-D S Q^(-2)) + (dif) / (dif Q) (H/2) \ \
    &= -D S dot (dif) / (dif Q) (Q^(-2)) + 0 \ \
    &= -D S dot (-2) Q^(-3) \ \
    &= (2 D S) / Q^3
$

Since $D, S, Q > 0$, $(dif^2 "TC")/(dif Q^2) > 0$ for all $Q > 0$, confirming $"TC"(Q)$ is convex and the critical point $Q^* = sqrt((2 D S) / H)$ is indeed a minimum.

```py
import math

Q = math.sqrt((2 * D * S) / H)
```

#example[
  #let D = 20
  #let S = 20
  #let H = 20

  #let TC(Q) = (D / Q) * S + (Q / 2) * H

  #let EOQ = calc.sqrt((2 * D * S) / H)
  #let EOQ-display = calc.round(EOQ, digits: 2)

  #let Q-values = lq.linspace(1, 20, num: 1000)
  #let tc-values = Q-values.map(TC)

  #let minimum-cost = TC(EOQ)
  #let minimum-cost-display = calc.round(minimum-cost, digits: 2)

  - $D = #D$
  - $S = #S$
  - $H = #H$

  $
    Q^*
    &= sqrt((2 D S) / H) \
    &= sqrt((2 (#D) (#S)) / #H) \
    &= #EOQ-display
  $

  $
    "TC"(Q^*)
    &= (D/Q) S + (Q/2) H \
    &= (#D / #EOQ-display) #S + (#EOQ-display / 2) #H \
    &= #minimum-cost-display
  $

Closed-form optimal cost

$
  "TC"(Q^*) = sqrt(2 D S H)
$

== Sensitivity Analysis

The ratio of actual cost to optimal cost depends only on $r = Q\/Q^*$:

$
  "TC"(Q) / "TC"(Q^*) = 1/2 (r + 1/r)
$

How much does it actually cost you to get $Q$ wrong? $"TC"(Q)$ is quite flat
near $Q^*$ --- being off by 20% on your order quantity typically costs only
a percent or two more in total cost.

#example[
  #let tolerance = 1.05
  #let sqrt-disc = calc.sqrt(calc.pow(tolerance, 2) - 1)
  #let r-low = tolerance - sqrt-disc
  #let r-high = tolerance + sqrt-disc

  #let r-low-display = calc.round(r-low, digits: 2)
  #let r-high-display = calc.round(r-high, digits: 2)

  #let cost-ratio(r) = (r + 1 / r) / 2
  #let r-values = lq.linspace(0.4, 2.5, num: 1000)
  #let ratio-values = r-values.map(cost-ratio)

  A #calc.round((tolerance - 1) * 100, digits: 0)% cost tolerance permits ordering
  anywhere between #r-low-display and #r-high-display times $Q^*$.

    lq.vlines(r-high, stroke: (paint: red, dash: "dashed", thickness: 1.5pt)),
  )
]

=== Derivation of the cost-ratio formula

Start with the total cost function:

$
  "TC"(Q) = (D/Q) S + (Q/2) H
$

Recall from the EOQ derivation that

$
  (Q^*)^2 = (2 D S) / H,
$

which rearranges to

$
  D S = (H (Q^*)^2) / 2.
$

Substituting into $"TC"(Q)$:

$
  "TC"(Q)
  &= (D / Q) S + (Q / 2) H \
  &= (D S) / Q + (Q H) / 2 \
  &= (H (Q^*)^2) / (2 Q) + (Q H) / 2 \
  &= H / 2 ((Q^*)^2 / Q + Q)
$

Plugging in $Q = Q^*$ gives

$
  "TC"(Q^*)
  &= H / 2 (Q^* + Q^*) \
  &= H / 2 Q^* + H / 2 Q^* \
  &= H Q^*
$

and since $Q^* = sqrt((2 D S) \/ H)$,

$
  H Q^*
  &= H sqrt((2 D S) / H) \
  &= sqrt(H^2 dot (2 D S) / H) \
  &= sqrt(2 D S H),
$

which matches the familiar

$
  "TC"(Q^*) = sqrt(2 D S H).
$

Now form the ratio of actual to optimal cost:

$
  "TC"(Q) / "TC"(Q^*)
  &= (H/2 ((Q^*)^2 / Q + Q)) / (H Q^*) \
  &= 1/2 (Q^* / Q + Q / Q^*)
$

Letting $r = Q \/ Q^*$ (the fraction of the optimal order size you actually
used) gives the clean result:

$
  "TC"(Q) / "TC"(Q^*) = 1/2 (r + 1/r)
$

This ratio depends only on how far off (proportionally) you are from $Q^*$
--- not on $D$, $S$, or $H$ individually.

== Reorder Point (ROP)

Inventory level at which you should place a new order so that the replacement stock arrives just as your existing stock runs out

$
  "ROP" = d L
$

Where:
- $d$: Demand rate (units / unit time), expressed in the same time unit as $L$

- $L$: Lead time (unit time)

- $"ROP"$: Reorder point (units)

#example[
  - $D$ is annual demand
  - $L$ Lead time is measured in days

  $
    d = D / 365
  $
]

=== Why $"ROP" = d L$

During the lead time $L$ between placing an order and receiving it, $d L$ units of demand will be consumed. To avoid a stockout, the next order must be placed exactly when the on-hand inventory equals this lead-time demand — i.e. when inventory falls to $"ROP" = d L$ — so that inventory reaches zero at the exact moment the new order arrives.

Note that $d$ and $L$ must share the same time unit for this to be dimensionally valid: $D$ from the EOQ derivation is often quoted as an annual rate, while $L$ is commonly measured in days or weeks. Using $D$ directly without converting it to match $L$'s time unit (e.g. $d = D/365$ for a daily rate when $L$ is in days) is a common source of ROP errors in practice.

=== Accounting for Demand Variability

The formula above assumes both demand and lead time are known with certainty — the same idealized assumption EOQ relies on. In practice, demand during the lead time varies, so a safety stock buffer $"SS"$ is added:

$
  "ROP" = d L + "SS"
$

A common choice, assuming demand during lead time is approximately normally distributed, is $"SS" = z sigma_(d L)$, where $sigma_(d L)$ is the standard deviation of demand over the lead time and $z$ is chosen from a target service level (e.g. $z approx 1.645$ for a 95% service level). This brings in real statistical machinery — happy to derive it fully in its own section if useful.

#example[
  #let D = 20
  #let S = 20
  #let H = 20
  #let L = 0.1

  #let EOQ = calc.sqrt((2 * D * S) / H)
  #let EOQ-display = calc.round(EOQ, digits: 2)

  #let T = EOQ / D
  #let T-display = calc.round(T, digits: 3)
  #let two-T-display = calc.round(2 * T, digits: 3)

  #let ROP = D * L
  #let ROP-display = calc.round(ROP, digits: 2)

  #let t1 = (EOQ - ROP) / D
  #let t1-display = calc.round(t1, digits: 3)

  - $D = #D$ units/year
  - $L = #L$ years
  - $Q^* = #EOQ-display$ units, giving a cycle time $T = Q^* / D = #T-display$ years

  $
    "ROP" &= D L \
    &= (#D)(#L) \
    &= #ROP-display
  $

  Solving for the time $t_1$ at which the inventory position depletes to $"ROP"$, starting each cycle at $Q^*$ and falling at rate $D$:

  $
    Q^* - D t_1 &= "ROP" \ \
    D t_1 &= Q^* - "ROP" \ \
    t_1 &= (Q^* - "ROP") / D \ \
    &= (#EOQ-display - #ROP-display) / #D \ \
    &= #t1-display "years"
  $

  Checking consistency: the order placed at $t_1$ should arrive exactly $L$ later, at the moment inventory hits zero, i.e. $t_1 + L = T$:

  $
    t_1 + L &= #t1-display + #L \ \
    &approx #T-display \ \
    &= T
  $

  #let inventory-cycle1(t) = EOQ - D * t
  #let inventory-cycle2(t) = EOQ - D * (t - T)

  #let cycle1-t = lq.linspace(0, T, num: 200)
  #let cycle1-inv = cycle1-t.map(inventory-cycle1)

  #let cycle2-t = lq.linspace(T, 2 * T, num: 200)
  #let cycle2-inv = cycle2-t.map(inventory-cycle2)
