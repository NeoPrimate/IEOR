Critical Ratio

Probability you *don't stock out*:
- Type-1 service level
- In-stock probability

$F(Q) = P(D lt.eq Q)$: the probability that demand is *at most* $Q$

The left side is the in-stock probability at the optimum:

$
  F(Q^*) = c_u / (c_u + c_o) \
  Q^* = F^(-1)(c_u / (c_u + c_o))
$

$
  c_u = p - c \
  c_o = c - s \
$

Where:
- $c$: unit cost cost per unit
- $p$: sale price per unit
- $s$: salvage price per unit

You order $Q$ units. Then demand $D$ shows up. One of two things happens:
- Case 1: You ordered too much ($Q > D$)

You sold $D$ units \
You have $Q - D$ leftover units sitting there, useless

- Case 2: You ordered too little ($Q < D$)

You sold $Q$ units (all you had)\
You missed out on $D − Q$ sales you could have made.

Notice these cases are mutually exclusive. You're either over or under — never both at the same time.

Attach a Cost to Each Mistake

- Each leftover unit costs you $c_o$ (overage cost)
- Each missed sale costs you $c_u$ (underage cost)

So the actual cost for a given realization of demand $D$ is:

$
  C = cases(
    c_o dot (Q - D) "if" Q > D quad "(overage)",
    c_u dot (D - Q) "if" D > Q quad "(underage)",
  )
$

The $(⋅)^+$ Notation is a Trick to Combine Both Cases

Writing piecewise functions is clunky. The notation $(x)^+ = max(x, 0)$ lets us collapse both cases into one expression:

$
  (Q - D)^+ = cases(
    Q - D "if" Q > D,
    0 "otherwise",
  )
$

$
  (D - Q)^+ = cases(
    D - Q "if" D > Q,
    0 "otherwise",
  )
$

So the total cost for a given $D$ becomes:

$
   C(Q, D) = c_o dot (Q − D)^+ + c_u dot (D − Q)^+
$

Why does this work? Because at most one of these terms is nonzero for any given $D$. If:
- $D < Q$: the first term is positive and the second is zero.
- $D > Q$: the first term is zero and the second is positive.
- $D = Q$: both are zero

We can't minimize a random quantity directly. We minimize its average over the distribution of demand. That's why we take the expectation:

$
   EE[C(Q, D)] = EE[c_o dot (Q − D)^+ + c_u dot (D − Q)^+]
$

By linearity of expectation (constants pull out, sums split):

$
   C(Q) = c_o dot EE[(Q − D)^+] + c_u dot EE[(D − Q)^+]
$

We want to find the $Q$ that minimizes:

$
   C(Q) &= c_o dot EE[(Q − D)^+] + c_u dot EE[(D − Q)^+] \
   Q^∗ &= arg min_Q​C(Q)
$

== Rewrite the Expectations as Integrals:

$
  EE[(Q - D)^+] = integral_0^Q (Q - x) f(x) dif x
$

$
  EE[(D - Q)^+] = integral_Q^infinity (x - Q) f(x) dif x
$

- We're averaging $(Q − x)$ over all values of $x$, weighted by how likely each $x$ is. But $(Q - x)^+$ is zero whenever $x > Q$, so we only integrate from 0 to $Q$. Above $Q$, the integrand vanishes.
- We're averaging $(x − Q)$ over all values of $x$, weighted by how likely each $x$ is. But $(x - Q)^+$ is zero whenever $x < Q$, so we only integrate from $Q$ to $infinity$. Below $Q$, the integrand vanishes.

$
  C(Q) = c_o dot integral_0^Q (Q - x) f(x) dif x + c_u dot integral_Q^infinity (x - Q) f(x) dif x
$

== Differentiate with Respect to $Q$

We need $(dif C) / (dif Q)$, the value of $Q$ that minimzes $C(Q)$. 

1. First Term (upper limit depends on $Q$)

$
  dif / (dif Q) [integral_0^Q (Q - x) f(x) dif x]
$

$
  &= underbrace(integral_0^Q partial / (partial Q) (Q - x) f(x) dif x, "differentiate inside") + underbrace((Q - x) bar_(x=Q) dot f(Q) dot (dif Q) / (dif Q), "boundary term (upper limit)") \
  &= integral_0^Q 1 dot f(x) dif x + (Q - Q) dot f(Q) dot 1 \
  &= integral_0^Q f(x) dif x + 0 \
  &= F(Q)
$

2. Second term

$
  dif / (dif Q) [integral_Q^infinity (x - Q) f(x) dif x]
$

$
  &= underbrace(integral_Q^infinity partial / (partial Q) (x - Q) f(x) dif x, "differentiate inside") - underbrace((x - Q) bar_(x=Q) dot f(Q) dot (dif Q) / (dif Q), "boundary term (lower limit)") \
  &= integral_Q^infinity (-1) dot f(x) dif x - (Q - Q) dot f(Q) dot 1 \
  &= - integral_Q^infinity f(x) dif x - 0 \
  &= -(1 - F(Q))
$

Putting it all together

$
  (dif C) / (dif Q) = c_o dot F(Q) - c_u dot (1 - F(Q))
$

== Set the Derivative to Zero

$
  c_o​dot F(Q^∗) − c_u​dot (1 − F(Q^∗)) = 0
$

Solve:

$
  c_o​dot F(Q^∗) = c_u​- c_u​dot F(Q^∗) \
  c_o​dot F(Q^∗) + c_u​dot F(Q^∗) = c_u​− c_u​dot F(Q^∗) + c_u​dot F(Q^∗) \
  c_o​dot F(Q^∗) + c_u​dot F(Q^∗) = c_u \
  F(Q^*) (c_o + c_u) = c_u \
  F(Q^*) = c_u / (c_u + c_o)​
$

This is the critical ratio (or critical fractile). The optimal order quantity is the one where the CDF of demand equals this ratio.
In other words:

$
  Q^* = F^(-1) (c_u / (c_u + c_o))
$

== Check It's a Minimum (Not a Maximum)

Take the second derivative of:

$
  (dif C) / (dif Q) = c_0 dot F(Q) - c_u dot (1 - F(Q))
$

Using:

$
  dif / (dif Q) F(Q) = f(Q) \
  dif / (dif Q) [1 - F(Q)] = -f(Q) \ 
$

We get:

$
  (dif^2 C) / (dif Q^2) = c_o dot f(Q) + c_u dot f(Q) = (c_o + c_u) f(Q) gt.eq 0
$

Since this is non-negative (assuming $f(Q) gt 0$), $C(Q)$ is convex and the critical ratio is the global minimum.

== Profit Maximization

The same $Q^*$ can be obtained by maximizing profit rather than minimizing costs:

$
  Pi(Q) = p dot EE[min(Q, D)] + s dot EE[(Q−D)^+] − c dot Q \
  Q^* = arg max_Q Pi(Q)
$

  C(Q) = c_o sum_(k=0)^Q (Q - k) p(k) + c_u sum_(k=Q+1)^infinity (k - Q) p(k)

Finite differences:

$
  Delta C(Q) = C(Q + 1) - C(Q)
$

$
  Delta C(Q) = c_o dot F(Q) - c_u dot (1 - F(Q))
$

$
  Q^* = min { Q: F(Q) gt.eq c_u / (c_u + c_o) }
