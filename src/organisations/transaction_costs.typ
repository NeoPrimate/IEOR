=== Transaction Costs

Why do firms / organizations exist? Why not many atomized individuals (market)?

Why are there hierarchies (firms / organizations) in markets?

Hierarchy or Market? Make or Buy?
Which transactions should be included in the hierarchy, which transactions should be left to the market?

Unit of analysis: Transaction
Relation (networks)

Traditional assumption:
Using the market has no cost (frictionless)

If trust there would be no cost
But the risk of opportunism, shirking exists

Therefore, there are costs:
- Search
- Bargaining
- Monitoring / Enforcement: ensuring that the terms of the agreement are being fulfilled (inspection, quality control, and supervision)
- Information: expenses incurred in acquiring, processing, and disseminating information relevant to the transaction
- Coordination
- Adaptation

Costs are a function of:
- Asset Specificity
- Uncertainty
- Frequency



Efficient alignment hypothesis:
Transactions, which vary in their characteristics, should be matched with governance structures that differ in their costs and competencies.â€¨Alignment aims to minimize transactions costs.

Questions:

- For you which transactions should be included in the hierarchy and which should be left to the market?
- Furthermore, which transactions included in hierarchies should be in public hierarchies and which in private hierarchies?
- How can this transaction sort approaches be used to predict end symbiosis?
